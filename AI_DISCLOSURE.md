# AI Usage Disclosure

In the preparation of this assignment, Artificial Intelligence tools were utilized to assist in writing and refining the explanations. Specifically:

- **Text Formulation:** AI was used to draft, proofread, and structure the markdown explanations within the Jupyter Notebook (`assignment_1_Christoph_Rintz.ipynb`) to ensure clarity, proper grammar, and a professional engineering tone. The AI helped translate technical Data Leakage concepts and pipeline constraints into well-formulated sentences.
- **Code Generation:** AI assisted in writing boilerplate code for executing the preprocessing pipeline via `scikit-learn` and generating the associated visual plots (`matplotlib`).

All final decisions and pipeline assembly logic were reviewed to ensure they correctly address the assignment requirements and adhere to machine learning foundation principles as taught in the course.
