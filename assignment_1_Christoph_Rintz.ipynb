    "**Target Selection:**\n",
    "The target variable is `y`. `y` records `\"yes\"` or `\"no\"` indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit. This aligns with the stated objective of the direct marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid Alternatives:**\n",
    "Three other variables might appear to be valid targets but must not be used:\n",
    "1. `duration`: This represents the call duration in seconds. While highly correlated with `y`, it is an outcome of the call. At prediction time (before or during the start of the call), this information is unavailable. Predicting `duration` does not address the business goal of identifying who will subscribe. Including it results in data leakage.\n",
    "2. `poutcome`: Records the result of the previous marketing campaign. The prediction objective defined for this assignment is whether the client subscribes in the current campaign. `poutcome` describes an event that has already occurred and is available as an input at prediction time — it is an input feature, not the target. Using it as a prediction target would mean predicting something already known, which has no operational value.\n",
    "3. `campaign`: Records the number of contacts performed during the current campaign. One might argue this represents campaign effort worth predicting or optimizing. However, `campaign` is a campaign execution variable accumulated during the contact process — it is not the business outcome. The goal is predicting client behavior (`y`), not the number of calls made. It is also partially available at prediction time (current call count), making its use as a target conceptually incoherent.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Target & Data Loading** (Completed above)\n",
    "    - Allowed: Raw dataset viewing, broad target assessment.\n",
    "    - Not allowed: Predicting on or analyzing combinations of target vs features globally.\n",
    "    - Leakage risk if changed: None at this stage, assuming `duration` is dropped manually before modeling metrics run.\n",
    "2. **Managing Missing Values (Identification & Structural Cleaning)**\n",
    "    - Allowed: Finding distinct string literals (e.g. `\"unknown\"`) or sentinel values (`999`) and structurally replacing them with `NaN` or indicator flags.\n",
    "    - Not allowed: Computing median, mean, or mode across the column to fill the `NaN` values.\n",
    "    - Leakage risk if changed: Replacing `\"unknown\"` specifically does not use global distribution data. However, if statistical imputation were performed here instead, it would leak test-set central tendencies into the training data.\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting**\n",
    "    - Allowed: Raw input variables (`X`) and targets (`y`).\n",
    "    - Not allowed: Any fitted statistical boundaries, encodings, or synthetic samples.\n",

    "    - Not allowed: Test set distribution properties.\n",

    "5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**\n",
    "    - Allowed: List of distinct categories present in `X_train`.\n",
    "    - Not allowed: Categories that only exist in `X_test`.\n",
    "    - Leakage risk if changed: The algorithm would map dummy dimensions for categories it has not seen yet.\n",
    "6. **Feature Scaling**\n",
    "    - Allowed: Compute mean and variance only over `X_train` via `.fit()`.\n",
    "    - Not allowed: Running `.fit()` on `X_test`.\n",
    "    - Leakage risk if changed: If placed before Data Splitting, the feature distances for the test set observations would be compressed based on training outliers.\n",

    "    - Not allowed: Entire dataset correlations.\n",
