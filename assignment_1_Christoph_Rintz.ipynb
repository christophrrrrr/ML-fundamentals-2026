    "**Strategy & Justification:**\n",
    "Because we are utilizing Logistic Regression, instead of synthesizing fake points via SMOTE (which risks geometric boundary distortion in high-dimensional one-hot setups), the mathematically elegant approach is to modify the algorithm's loss function via `class_weight='balanced'`. \n",
    "This dynamically weights the loss gradients. A false negative (missing a 'yes') is penalized 9x more heavily than a false positive.\n",

    "Instead of missing every single prospective client, the model now demonstrates strong *Recall*, capturing a massive segment of true subscribers (\"yes\"). In a marketing context, calling a few false positives is drastically cheaper than missing out on willing subscribers, proving our pipeline and structural decisions succeed at capturing structural variance rather than lazily chasing accuracy!\n"
