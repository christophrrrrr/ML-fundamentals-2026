    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Target & Data Loading** (Completed above)\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** Raw dataset viewing, broad target assessment.\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Predicting on or analyzing combinations of target vs features globally.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** None at this conceptual stage, as long as `duration` is dropped manually before modeling metrics run.\n",
    "2. **Managing Missing Values (Identification & Structural Cleaning)**\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** Finding distinct string literals (e.g. `\"unknown\"`) or sentinel values (`999`) and structurally replacing them with `NaN` or indicator flags.\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Computing median, mean, or mode across the column to fill the `NaN` values.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** Replacing `\"unknown\"` specifically does not use global distribution data. However, if *statistical* imputation were performed here instead, it would leak test-set central tendencies into the training data.\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting**\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** Raw input variables (`X`) and targets (`y`).\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Any fitted statistical boundaries, encodings, or synthetic samples.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** If delayed to later in the pipeline, every transformation step ahead of it would accidentally consume information belonging strictly to the test set, compromising final evaluation integrity.\n",
    "4. **Managing Missing Values (Statistical Imputation)**\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** Medians/Modes calculated strictly from `X_train`.\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Test set distribution properties.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** If placed before Data Splitting, the median would include test observations.\n",
    "5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** List of distinct categories present purely in `X_train`.\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Categories that only exist in `X_test`.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** The algorithm would map dummy dimensions for categories it conceptually hasn't \"seen\" yet, failing in real-world scenarios where unknown inputs arrive.\n",
    "6. **Feature Scaling**\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** Compute mean and variance only over `X_train` via `.fit()`.\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Running `.fit()` on `X_test`.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** If placed before Data Splitting, the feature distances for the test set observations would be mathematically compressed based on training outliers (or vice versa).\n",
    "7. **Feature Selection**\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** Variance thresholds and correlation matrices computed *over* `X_train`.\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Entire dataset correlations.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** If executed upfront, we would delete variables based on how they correlate with target labels inside the pristine test set.\n",
    "8. **Addressing Class Imbalance**\n",
    "    - ✅ **Allowed:** Resampling methods (SMOTE) or algorithmic weightings applied entirely within the training vault.\n",
    "    - 🚫 **Not allowed:** Resampling before Data Splitting.\n",
    "    - ⚠️ **Leakage risk if changed:** If SMOTE generated synthetic samples before the train/test split, synthesized points mathematically linked to train observations would bleed across the boundary and land in the test set. Recall scores would artificially inflate due to structural duplication rather than true generalization power.\n",

    "**Incorrect Ordering Example (Scaling before Splitting):** \n",
    "If we performed **Feature Scaling** before **Data Splitting**, we would calculate the mean and standard deviation across the *entire* dataset. The standardized test values would inherently contain information about the central tendency of the training set. This is a classic form of data leakage, artificially inflating the test evaluation metrics because the test data \"peeked\" into the global distribution.\n",

    "**Incorrect Ordering Example (SMOTE before Splitting):**\n",

    "**Strategy & Justification:**\n",
    "Because we are utilizing Logistic Regression, instead of synthesizing fake points via SMOTE (which risks geometric boundary distortion in high-dimensional one-hot setups), the mathematically elegant approach is to modify the algorithm's loss function via `class_weight='balanced'`. \n",
    "This dynamically weights the loss gradients. A false negative (missing a 'yes') is penalized 9x more heavily than a false positive.\n",
